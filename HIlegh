What is this thing?

    It is a software contract.

Can I use it?

    You can certainly use it, but if your project is serious, I discourage that
    you use it.

How do I use it?

    If you want to use it, simply cause it to accompany your software.

Will it work perfectly?

    I am not a law adviser, so I don't know. If you use it, you take a risk.
